  <h1> Daniel Mitchell</h1>
  <p> Mr. Daniel Mitchell received a Masterâ€™s in Electrical and Electronic Engineering with distinction from Heriot-Watt University in 2020. He is currently a PhD Research Student at the University of Glasgow and is also a Visiting Student Researcher at California Institute of Technology (Caltech). His research focuses on symbiotic multi-robot fleets which look to address robotic teams connected with a human-in-the-loop operator. In addition to this, he develops a novel dual application sensing mechanism which uses non-destructive sensing for asset integrity inspection and foresight monitoring for robotic platforms. In 2023 he was presented with the IET Rising Star Award at the IET Excellence and Innovation Awards. Since 2019 he has worked as part of MicroSense Technologies Ltd developing novel radar sensing which has seen collaborations of work alongside the Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (ORCA) Hub.</p
